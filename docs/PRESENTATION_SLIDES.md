    // Shared memory optimization
    __shared__ float As[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];
    __shared__ float Bs[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];
    
    // Thread and block indexing
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    
    // Memory coalescing and compute optimization
    float sum = 0.0f;
    // ... optimized implementation
