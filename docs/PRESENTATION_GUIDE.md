## ðŸš€ How to Use These Materials

### For Video Recording:
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\artam\OneDrive\Desktop\Ranjani_job\CUDA project\CUDA_AI_PerfTest"

# Run the interactive presentation
python scripts/presentation.py

# Or run just the demo for screen recording
python scripts/demo.py
```

### For Live Presentation:
1. Use `PRESENTATION_SLIDES.md` as your slide deck
2. Reference `PRESENTER_NOTES.md` for talking points
3. Run `scripts/presentation.py` for live demonstration
4. Have GitHub repository open: https://github.com/ranjaniatwork/CUDA_AI_PERFTEST

### For Peer Review:
- **Repository URL:** https://github.com/ranjaniatwork/CUDA_AI_PERFTEST  
- **Presentation Video:** Record yourself running `scripts/presentation.py`
- **Demo URL:** Upload video of the presentation to YouTube/Vimeo (unlisted)

## ðŸ“‹ Technical Demo Points to Emphasize

### CUDA Expertise:
- Show actual kernel code with optimization techniques
- Demonstrate cuBLAS integration and performance comparison
- Explain memory coalescing and shared memory usage
- Highlight NVTX profiling integration

### AI Integration:
- Live anomaly detection with real performance data
- Explain Isolation Forest algorithm choice and training
- Show confidence scoring and statistical analysis
- Demonstrate automated baseline management

### Enterprise Value:
- Docker containerization for reproducible environments
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with automated testing
- Professional logging, error handling, and reporting
- Real-world applicability in production environments

## ðŸŽ¥ Presentation Tips

### Before Recording:
- [ ] Test all scripts run without errors
- [ ] Prepare backup screenshots in case of technical issues
- [ ] Practice timing - aim for 8 minutes plus 2 minutes Q&A buffer
- [ ] Have GitHub repository open in browser tab
- [ ] Test screen recording software and audio

### During Presentation:
- [ ] Start with enthusiasm and clear project introduction
- [ ] Show actual code and live demo - this is your key differentiator
- [ ] Emphasize real-world enterprise value, not just academic exercise
- [ ] Connect back to CUDA curriculum learning objectives
- [ ] End confidently and invite questions

### After Presentation:
- [ ] Upload video to platform accessible to reviewers
- [ ] Ensure repository is public and accessible
- [ ] Double-check all artifacts are committed and pushed
- [ ] Test repository clone from fresh environment
